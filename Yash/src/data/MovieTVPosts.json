        "Nazi-despising, unstoppable force of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). The movie thus centers itself around the inevitable clash between Landa",

      "quote": "What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?",
      "thoughts": [
        "This movie to me is one of the greats when it comes to portraying desolation and possibly nihilism.",
        "Anton Chigurh (Bardem) does so well as a psychopathic serial killer because he believes he's a vassal for an indifferent universe, bringing death to those he thinks are momentary specks in the scheme of fate. All his scenes work to deliver this message in fact; from when he determined whether a gas station attendant lived or died by a coin flip, to taunting Carla Jean for telling him he doesn't 'have to' kill her.",
        "What's more interesting is that at the end, Anton himself almost dies in a car crash and has to bribe 2 teenage boys for their silence as he runs off on foot. Whether Anton knows he himself is subject to fate, or he wrongly assumed he was a proteced agent of fate is unknown, but it was a brilliant choice by the Coens to send off his character on this note.",
        "While we're here, an interesting ambiguity for me was in the scene where Anton kills someone and the victim's assistant ponders on whether he would die too. Anton says, 'I don't know. Do you see me?'. This could either be taken as saying he would spare the assistant if he doesn't tell anyone anything, or that Anton sees himself as some sort of Grim Reaper and that the assistant seeing him means his death is confirmed.",
        "More on the uninhibited twisted hand of fate though, we have the characters of Llewellyn Moss (Brolin) and Sheriff Bell (Jones). The Coens making us follow Moss for over half the movie as he desperately flees from Chigurh and then abruptly killing him off screen at the hand of some subplot-related Mexican gangsters was a very pronounced choice in feeding into the theme of the movie: that most things in real life aren't wrapped up with a bow.",
        "Similarly, Sheriff Bell retiring in the middle of the case because he's afraid that the winds, specifically Chigurh, are too strong for him to tussle with is perhaps closest to the title of the movie itself. I interpret the title as meaning no one grows old in such desolate lands as those populated by monsters like Chigurh. Certainly when Bell reminisces on being 20 years older now than his father, also a sheriff, when he died, I feel emboldened in my interpretation.",
        "A few have criticized NCFOM as pointless and self-indulgent, but I think it is a movie driven very strongly by its choices in writing and direction to deliver a certain message and does so successfully."

        "also seems cut from the same cloth somehow in some small way. The evidence of this being how the supposedly reverent Eli Sunday (Dano) beats his father for letting",
        "Daniel in their space, and comes back to a weak Daniel to bargain in bad-faith for more money and land. In general the brilliance of acting in TWWB does not need to",
        "be repeated, but certainly I was sold by the way Day-Lewis and Dano manipulated even the finest mannerisms of their characters to sell the setting of the story",

        "and the grotesque machinations of his uncle William \"King\" Hale (De Niro). Acting wise, Gladstone was phenomenal in eliciting rage and sorrow in the abuse she suffered",
        "at the hands of Hale and his cronies. Even having sparse dialogue, her expressions and body language conveyed a rich tapestry of emotions - an example being her silent",
        "but scathing disappointment in Ernest when he doesn't admit to the truth of poisoning her insulin. DiCaprio meanwhile transforms himself into the simple-minded, meek-mannered",
        "character of Ernest; truly earning praise during the court testimony scene when it breaks him to confess to shamelessly enabling his uncle's borderline evil exploits against",
        "his wife. The cinematography served to remind audiences that this is a historical narration above being merely a movie, with the blending in of B&W (possibly modern recreated)",
        "footage of the Osage people, and chilling sequences of shots of murdered Osage akin to casket photos. The use of tint was very deliberate in creating different auras in the film -",
        "rich and lively for the culturally delightful Osage celebrations, blueing and grey for Hale's schemes and the court scenes, and orange and red for Mollie's worsening health.",
        "Through acting and cinematography alone I can truly appreciate KOTF as a fine example of cinema. Still, there is the screenplay to praise. It was obvious how much effort Scorsese put into",
        "doing justice to the Osage, while still achieving a nuanced portrayal by telling much of the story from the perspective of Ernest. Showing Ernest's realisation that he cannot ignorantly support",
        "his uncle while also wanting a family with Mollie was very effective for example, in illustrating how one doesn't dread the poison they are enabling until it comes back to corrupt the water they drink.",
        "All in all, KOTF is a very finely narrated, heart-wrenching story that I am glad Scorsese picked up. I've appreciated many movies in the past and while this one isn't necessarily objectively better than them,",
