        "This problem is a typical candidate for a greedy strategy.",
        "First recognise that for any optimal solution that maximises the sum of k number of children's happiness,",
        "subtracting any one of the children's happiness will necessarily give us the optimal solution for k - 1 children's happiness.",
        "In a bottom-up sense, this simply means that in every round from 1 to k, we are reliably choosing a child that will maximise our final happiness in the end.",
        "Second, realise that in any optimal solution over 1 to k selections of children, the child with the maximum happiness in that round is included.",
        "Again this simply translates to: sort the initial happiness list and select the maximally happy un-selected child at each selection round from 1 to k.",
        "To meet the additional problem requirements, we decrement the happiness of the child we are selecting by 1...k each time (and only do this the child we are immediately selecting, ",
        "to prevent k-many full linear iterations of the happiness list). Lastly, ensure that we do not add negative happiness by taking Max(0, child's happiness - decrement) when summing up happiness."
