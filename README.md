## Yashwit's Website (W.I.P.)

Version 2! Migrated from [here](https://github.com/yashpola/yashpola). Major differences are that this site is built using Vanilla CSS instead of MaterialUI (to reduce performance overhead) and Vite-Typescript instead of CreateReactApp-JavaScript. I'm still deployed at [https://yashwit.com](https://yashwit.com)

Feel free to give me feedback [here](https://github.com/yashpola/me/issues)

### What I use my site for:

---

- Recording my [thoughts](https://yashwit.com/thoughts) on the courses I take in school as well as [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems I do.
- Reviewing [movies](https://yashwit.com/movies) and [tv shows](https://yashwit.com/tv) that I watch.
- Showcasing my [portfolio](https://yashwit.com/portfolio).

### Why I remade my site:

---

- Opportunity to learn Typescript
- Decouple from MUI and focus on HTML/CSS rules + hygiene
- Build over Vite instead of CRA

### What I didn't focus on for this rebuild:

#### (but still want to learn in another project)

---

- GitHub utilisation (Branching, PRs, Commit Structuring etc)
- Frontend/Backend deployment
- Look into Next, Express, etc
