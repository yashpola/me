## Yashwit's Website (W.I.P.)

Version 2! Migrated from [here](https://github.com/yashpola/yashpola) but I'm still deployed at [https://yashwit.com](https://yashwit.com)

Feel free to give me feedback [here](https://github.com/yashpola/me/issues)

### What I use my site for:

---

- Recording my [thoughts](https://yashwit.com/learnings) on the courses I take in school.
- Reviewing [movies](https://yashwit.com/movies) and [tv shows](https://yashwit.com/tv) that I watch.
- Showcasing my [portfolio](https://yashwit.com/portfolio).

### Why I remade my site:

---

- Familiarise with Typescript (I don't see myself returning to JavaScript tbh...).
- Decouple from MUI (to reduce performance overhead) and focus on purer ground-up building with TSX/HTML/CSS.
- Build over Vite instead of CRA (also for performance).

### What I didn't focus on for this rebuild:

#### (but still want to learn in another project)

---

- GitHub utilisation (Branching, PRs, Commit Structuring etc).
- Frontend/Backend deployment (Next, Express, etc.)
